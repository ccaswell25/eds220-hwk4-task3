    "\n",
    "The data was accessed and pre-processed in the Microsoft Planetary Computer to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution ([Landsat Collection in MPC](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2)). Data should be used for visualization purposes only. \n",
